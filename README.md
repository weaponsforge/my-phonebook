## my-phonebook

My Phonebook is an online multi-user web application clone of a regular Contacts application for mobile phones. It will let users securely manage their Contacts by allowing them to create a new Contact, edit or delete existing Contacts, view the information of an existing Contact, and view a list of existing Contacts. Moreover, it will let users search for existing Contact and export Contacts information into a CSV and PDF file.

My Phonebook will consist of a front-end website (client) and a secure REST API running on the backend. It will implement security best practices through a registration and login component. Users will be able to view and manage only the Contacts that they create.

> This project will also serve as a practice for catching up and implementing best practices for using React, Firebase, Express and general software development.
